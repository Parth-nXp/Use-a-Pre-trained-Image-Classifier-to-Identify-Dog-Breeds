# Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This repository contains a project from the **Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree**. The goal of this project is to build a command-line application that uses a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds from images. The application also detects human faces and predicts the most similar dog breed for any human face input.

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG, ResNet, and AlexNet for efficient image classification.
- **Human Face Detection**: If a human face is detected in an input image, the application predicts the closest dog breed.
- **Dog Breed Classification**: For images of dogs, the classifier predicts the specific breed of the dog from a provided dataset.
